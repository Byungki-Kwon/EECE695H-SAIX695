# PA 3: Analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks

In this assignment, you analyze Convolution Neural Networks. In particular, you are playing with AlexNet (“ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks” by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, NIPS 2012), which is the winning entry in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 but simple and manageable standard backbone networks. Through this assignment, we aim to understand what a pre-trained CNN learns.

Special thanks: This PA design is inspired from PA5 of Cornell CS5670 (By Noah Snavely and Abe Davis).
